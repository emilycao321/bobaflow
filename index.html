		<p>So you might be wondering what was it about bubble milk tea that made me want to make this website.</p><br>
		<p>Well, the reason is because I wanted to shared to other people about my favorite bubble milk tea drinks, but also promote my Asian culture. I wanted other people who have never heard of bubble tea to try it out with the recommendations I made, meaning my top favorites 
			drink from each store I have tried. I hope to spread one important aspect of Asian culture that is not limited to only one country.</p><br>
			<p>The source of all bubbles teas it would seem, at Chun Shui Tang teahouse in Taichung, Taiwan. 
			The founder, Liu Han-Chieh, first came up with the idea of serving Chinese tea cold in the early 1980s after visiting Japan where he saw coffee served cold. Then, in 1988, his product development manager, Ms. Lin Hsiu Hui, 
			was sitting in a staff meeting and had brought with her a typical Taiwanese dessert called fen yuan, a sweetened tapioca pudding. Just for fun she poured the tapioca balls into her Assam iced tea and drank it. This was how bubble milk tea came about.</p><br>

			<p>Most bubble milk tea chains originated from Taiwan, but bubble milk tea is part of a lot of Asian cultures. 
			In Asian cultures, tea is a big part of our tradition. We drink tea when we are eating out with families and friends or when giving our offerings to our elderlies or ancestors.
			From a family that speaks Cantonese, my family take parts in the Cantonese tradition called Yum Cha (È£≤Ëå∂), which means drinking tea. 
			This tradition is when individuals gather together to drink traditional Chinese tea and eat dim sum. Tea is a staple part of my culture. My family continuosly drinks different teas, 
			from special flavored tea from <a href = "https://www.davidstea.com/us_en/home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David's Tea</a> or from traditional Chinese stores.
			I am one of the people who is deeply in love with bubble milk tea.<br><br></p>

			<p>Milk tea isn't only drank by Asians. Many people of different ethnicity drink bubble tea. Some will love them and others will question them. Bubble tea is great way to spread a significant part of not only Taiwanese culture, but many Asian culture.
